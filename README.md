# Mavlink Relay

## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

This a standalone ground station code I have have developed for relaying data through (both ways).
In essence this console-based app is used for all in-lab experiments where Optitrack Motion capture
system is needed. This was primarily used in WSL1 (Ubuntu) environment, but was also deployed and 
tested on arm64 platform (BeagleBone Blue and Black).
The operations is quite simple: you specify your telemetry radio port, mocap port and enable/disable 
data relay to/from local host.

This is being largely phased out by my new UI-based application - [KGroundControl](https://github.com/YevheniiKovryzhenko/KGroundControl.git),
so check it out!

I would like to express my appreciation to Ella Atkins for providing access to their ground station code.
